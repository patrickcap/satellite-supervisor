## Overview

This repository contains code for predicting the purpose of a satellite based on limited information. The purpose prediction is performed using machine learning techniques applied to satellite data.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the application of machine learning algorithms in predicting the purpose of satellites based on a limited set of features. The prediction model aims to classify the purpose of a satellite into predefined categories using the provided data.

## Features

- **Limited Information**: Predictions are made using only a subset of features available for each satellite.
- **Machine Learning**: Various machine learning algorithms are explored and evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting satellite purposes.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing techniques are applied to prepare the input data for model training.
- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of different models is evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their accuracy and reliability.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the prediction model:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/satellite-purpose-prediction.git

2. Install the required dependencies
